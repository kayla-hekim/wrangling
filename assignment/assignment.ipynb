        "**Q1.** This question provides some practice cleaning variables which have common problems.\n",
        "1. Numeric variable: For `./data/airbnb_hw.csv`, clean the `Price` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. How many missing values do you end up with? (Hint: What happens to the formatting when a price goes over 999 dollars, say from 675 to 1,112?)\n",
        "   * I just basically rid, based on the Price column, of outliers beyond the .25 and .75 quantiles. I didn't really have missing values, but there were 1518 values that were beyond the lower and upper range I set. These 1518 rows were removed.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing? \n",
        "   * According to the code below, out of the 12925 rows, 9848 rows were missing data, or had nan, in the subject_injury column. This is a huge concern because that is 3/4 of the data with no data in that column. If we just removed these 9848 rows, we would miss all the large amount of data possible in the other columns. However, if we were thinking about this semantically, it'd be nice to know if the subject was injured, but it might not be necessary to know if the police used force overall. It depends on what column you look at that you call this large amount of missing data as \"concerning\". \n",
        "   * I just changed the Nans to \"Unknown\" without removing the 9848 rows.\n",
        "   * Based on the cross tab lambda function to show how many missing values there are per feature, it appears that there's a weak pattern. `Less lethal` and `Maximal Restraint Technique` both show 100% missing values while `Firearm` and `Less Lethal Projectile` both show 0% missing data. Maybe when projectiles are involved, there's a stricter standard to report these incidents while whatever the 100% missing value rate features might have no restrictions on reporting. Somehow, it appears that the `taser` reports high amounts of missing data on injuries. It might be that subjects of tasers aren't easily injured by the taser in this dataset, but I feel like getting tased might cause a few bruises or painful days. It's interesting to me that this could happen, and the same goes for `bodily force`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Dummy variable: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable as well as you can, and, in particular, replace missing values with `np.nan`.\n",
        "   * It appears there was a weird 9 value other than 0 and 1, and there was 31 9's out of the total thousands of values. I just changed all 9's to np.nan in the column since it appeared they were either outliers or disguised unknowns.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Missing values, not at random: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. (Hint: Look at the `SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent` variable.)\n",
        "   * I explain most of my choices in the cell 1.4 listed below, but I just replaced nans or unkonwn values like ' ' to np.nan, \"eliminate\" outliers by taking the lower and upper bounds then keeping inclusively what's between both. I also convert the data types to floats by coercion, though there's probably a better way to format the numbers back from original strings."
